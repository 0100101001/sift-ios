## About
Sift can answer questions like: are apps tracking me even if I disable analytics? are apps malicious? are they connecting to strange urls? are they doing network activity in the background?

**Inspect network traffic for any app on your phone**. Using push notifications, Sift shows you real-time network requests made by other apps. 

**Monitor background activity**. Sift can even show you what network requests apps are making in the background.

**Create rules to block urls like tracking sites, ads, etc**. Use Sift to block any site you don't like for every app on your phone.

**Debugging tool for developers** Use Sift to debug network traffic for your production app: inspect background activity, see how your app handles connection failures to certain sites, etc.

**Sift is completely private** Sift never shares or sends your network traffic data anywhere. Data that Sift collects never leaves your phone.

## FAQ
### Why isn't Sift on the App Store?
It turns it out that network content filters are not permitted for regular app store apps (it only works in supervised device mode). So I decided to release the source code instead -- any donations are greatly appreciated :)

### How do I use it/install it?
Make sure you have XCode installed. Clone the code, plug in your phone, and hit run. You might have to authorize XCode to deploy to your phone/ sign into icloud in XCode.

### Support the new XCode 10?
Yep -- just look at the `xcode-10` branch?
